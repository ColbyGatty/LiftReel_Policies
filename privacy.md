# LiftReel Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: September 9, 2025**

**C&M Technologies LLC** ("C&M," "we," "us," or "our"), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of California, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information through the **LiftReel** app, including its website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the "App"). By accessing, downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy, our Terms and Conditions at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/terms](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/terms), our End User License Agreement (EULA) at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/eula](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/eula), and our License Agreement at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/license_agreement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColbyGatty/LiftReel_Policies/main/license.md). If you do not agree, you must not use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

- **Personal Information**:
  - **Account Information**: When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, username, password, self-reported age (not birthdate), and optionally your gender or profile picture. You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. If you indicate an age under 13, account creation is blocked.
  - **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Videos recorded in-app, competition ideas, and posts in the community tab or leaderboards. Videos may include your image, voice, or other identifiable features.
  - **Contact Information**: Information provided when you contact us via [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com).
- **Usage Data**:
  - Information about your interactions with the App, such as pages visited, features used (e.g., competitions, leaderboards), time spent, and in-app actions.
  - Device information, including device type, operating system, IP address, browser type, and unique device identifiers.
- **Children’s Information**:
  - We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, in compliance with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**. We collect self-reported age to ensure users are 13 or older. Users under 13 are prohibited from using the App, and lying about your age to gain access violates our Terms and Conditions. For users aged 13–17, we assume parental consent through your use of the App, as we do not directly verify consent. If you are under 13, you must not use the App.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Operate and provide the App’s features, such as account management, in-app video recording, competitions, leaderboards, and virtual rewards (e.g., trophies, XP, virtual gym upgrades).
- Host, display, and moderate UGC as permitted by the Terms and Conditions.
- Process in-app purchases or subscriptions through app stores and our payment processor.
- Analyze usage patterns to improve the App’s performance, functionality, and user experience.
- Communicate with you, including responding to support inquiries, sending service-related notifications, or providing updates about the App.
- Comply with legal obligations, such as responding to DMCA takedown notices or law enforcement requests.
- Protect the security and integrity of the App, including detecting and preventing fraud or unauthorized access.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We may share your information as follows:

- **With Service Providers**: We share information with third-party service providers (e.g., hosting providers, analytics platforms, payment processors) to operate the App, process transactions, or analyze usage. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for specified purposes.
- **For UGC**: Videos and competition ideas you post may be publicly visible in the App’s community tab or leaderboards, as permitted by the Terms and Conditions. You control what UGC you share, but public content may be viewed or shared by other users.
- **For Legal Purposes**: We may disclose information to comply with legal obligations, respond to subpoenas, court orders, or government requests, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users.
- **Business Transfers**: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to a successor entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.

We do not sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

  - Request deletion of your personal information.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

We are committed to complying with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. We collect self-reported age (not birthdates) to ensure users are at least 13 years old. Users under 13 are strictly prohibited from using the App, and lying about your age to gain access violates our Terms and Conditions. If you are under 13, you must not create an account or use the App. For users aged 13–17, we assume parental consent through your use of the App, as we do not directly verify consent. If we discover or are notified (e.g., via reports or parental inquiries) that a user is under 13, we will promptly delete their account and all associated personal information.

- **Parental Notice**: If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has used the App or provided personal information (e.g., name, email, videos), please contact us immediately at [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com). We will delete their account and all associated data promptly, typically within 5 business days, to comply with COPPA. You may also request to review your child’s data or prevent further collection. We do not offer a verification process for under-13 users, as the App is not intended for them.

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the App’s services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. UGC may be retained indefinitely as part of the license granted in the Terms and Conditions. You may request deletion as described in Section 4. If we discover a user is under 13, their data is deleted promptly.

## 8. International Data Transfers

If you access the App from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where data protection laws may differ. By using the App, you consent to such transfers. For EU residents, we ensure GDPR-compliant safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) for data transfers.

## 9. Third-Party Links and Services

The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., app stores, payment processors). We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Review their policies before providing information.

## 10. Modifications

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised version on the App or at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/privacy](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/privacy). Continued use of the App after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
