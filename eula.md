- Copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, distribute, publish, or create derivative works of the Software or its content, including code, designs, graphics, logos, leaderboards, or virtual items, except as permitted by applicable law.
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code or underlying structure of the Software, except where such actions are expressly permitted by applicable law despite this restriction.
- Sublicense, sell, rent, lease, assign, or transfer the Software or any rights under this EULA to any third party.

All rights not expressly granted in this EULA are reserved.

## 5. Updates and Modifications

- C&M may release updates, patches, or new versions of the Software, which may require acceptance of updated terms or new hardware/software requirements as a condition of continued use. C&M is not liable for any inability to use the Software due to incompatible devices or systems.
- We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Software or any features (e.g., leaderboards, competitions, rewards) at our sole discretion, with or without notice, and without liability to you.

## 6. User-Generated Content

- You may record and post videos and create competition ideas using the Software’s in-app recording feature, as permitted by the Terms and Conditions.
- Pursuant to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, C&M is not responsible for the content, accuracy, legality, or impact of UGC and is not liable for any damages, losses, or disputes arising therefrom.

## 7. Termination

- This EULA is effective until terminated by you or C&M. You may terminate this EULA by ceasing all use of the Software and deleting all copies from your device.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

- **No Liability for User Actions**: To the fullest extent permitted by law, C&M, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including but not limited to personal injury, property damage, emotional distress, loss of profits, data loss, or business interruption, arising from or related to your use of the Software, participation in competitions, recording or posting videos, or interactions with other users, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
