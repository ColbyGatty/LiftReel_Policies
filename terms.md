**Last Updated: September 9, 2025**

Welcome to **LiftReel**, a social media, gaming, and fitness application operated by **C&M Technologies LLC** ("C&M," "we," "us," or "our"), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of California. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of LiftReel, including its website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the "App"). By accessing, downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our End User License Agreement (EULA) at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/eula](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/eula), and, where applicable, our License Agreement at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/license_agreement](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/license_agreement). If you do not agree, you must not access or use the App.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

- You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under 18, you must have verifiable parental or legal guardian consent in compliance with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements and agree to these Terms, the EULA, and the License Agreement (if applicable).
- These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and C&M Technologies LLC. If you are accepting on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity.
- If you access the App from outside the United States, you are responsible for complying with applicable local laws, including data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR for European Union residents).

## 2. User Accounts

- **Account Creation**: To access certain App features (e.g., competitions, leaderboards, user-generated content), you must create an account and provide accurate, complete, and current information. You agree to update your information as necessary to maintain its accuracy.
- **Account Security**: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials (e.g., username, password) and for all activities conducted under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or use at [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com).
- **Account Suspension/Termination**: We reserve the right to suspend, terminate, or restrict your account or access to the App at our sole discretion, with or without notice, for violations of these Terms, the EULA, the License Agreement, or applicable law, or for any reason deemed necessary to protect the App or other users.

## 3. User-Generated Content (UGC)

The App allows you to record and post videos and create competition ideas in the community tab and leaderboards ("UGC").

- **In-App Recording Only**: All videos submitted to the App (e.g., for competitions or leaderboards) must be recorded in real-time using the App’s built-in recording feature. Uploading, importing, or submitting pre-recorded videos, videos saved on your device, or externally edited videos is strictly prohibited to ensure fairness, authenticity, and integrity of competitions. Any attempt to bypass this restriction may result in immediate account suspension or termination.
- **License Grant**: By posting UGC, you grant C&M Technologies LLC a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to host, use, store, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and create derivative works of your UGC for the purpose of operating, promoting, improving, or marketing the App and related services. You retain ownership of your UGC but waive any right to restrict C&M’s use as described or to claim additional compensation for such use.
- **Representations and Warranties**: You represent and warrant that your UGC:
  - Is recorded by you in real-time using the App’s recording feature.
  - Is original to you, or you have obtained all necessary rights, permissions, or licenses to post it.
  - Does not infringe any third-party rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright, trademark, patent) or rights of privacy or publicity.
  - Is not illegal, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, harassing, threatening, discriminatory, or otherwise prohibited by these Terms or applicable law.
  - Complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and App guidelines.
- **Community Validation**: UGC submitted to leaderboards or competitions is subject to community validation or invalidation processes. C&M does not guarantee the accuracy, fairness, or outcome of community decisions and is not liable for disputes, errors, or outcomes arising from such processes.
- **Content Moderation**: We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to monitor, review, edit, remove, or restrict access to UGC at our sole discretion, without notice, if it violates these Terms, is deemed inappropriate, or for any other reason. We are not responsible for any failure or delay in removing UGC.

## 4. Competitions and Rewards

- **Competitions**: You may create or participate in exercise-based competitions (e.g., max bench press in pounds) using videos recorded in-app. You are solely responsible for ensuring that competitions are safe, legal, and compliant with these Terms. C&M does not endorse or verify the safety of user-created competitions.
- **Rewards**: Virtual rewards (e.g., trophies, experience points (XP), profile customization, virtual gym upgrades) are provided for participation or achievement in competitions or leaderboards. These rewards are virtual, have no monetary value, and cannot be redeemed, transferred, or exchanged for cash or other consideration. C&M reserves the right to modify, discontinue, or revoke rewards at any time, with or without notice.
- **Liability**: To the fullest extent permitted by law, C&M, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents are not liable for any injuries, damages, losses, or disputes arising from participation in competitions or challenges, whether created by you or other users. You participate at your own risk and assume full responsibility for assessing the safety, feasibility, and legality of any exercise or challenge before participating.

## 5. Intellectual Property

- **App IP**: The App, including all code, designs, graphics, logos, text, leaderboards, virtual items, user interfaces, and the unique combination of social media, gaming, and fitness features, is owned by C&M Technologies LLC and protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reproduce, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App or its content without prior written consent from C&M.
- **User IP**: You retain intellectual property rights in your UGC, subject to the license granted to C&M in Section 3. You may not use, reproduce, or distribute another user’s UGC without their explicit permission.
- **DMCA Compliance**: If you believe your copyright has been infringed by UGC on the App, you may submit a takedown notice to [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com) that includes:
  - Your name, address, phone number, and email address.
  - A description of the copyrighted work allegedly infringed.

  - A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief the material is infringing and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on their behalf.
  - Your physical or electronic signature.
  - If your UGC is removed, you may submit a counter-notice to [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com) within 10 business days, including the above details and a statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed in error. We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and reserve the right to terminate accounts of repeat infringers.
- **Feedback**: Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you provide about the App are considered non-confidential and may be used by C&M without compensation or attribution.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

- **No Liability for UGC**: Pursuant to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, C&M is not liable for any UGC, including its accuracy, legality, quality, or impact. We are a platform and not the publisher or speaker of UGC.

- **Indemnity**: You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless C&M Technologies LLC, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your UGC, use of the App, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.
- **Disclaimer**: The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement. C&M does not guarantee the App’s availability, accuracy, security, or error-free operation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability, so these exclusions may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law.

## 8. Termination

## 9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

- **Binding Arbitration**: Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach thereof, shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California, in the English language, and the arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. The costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator.

## 14. Severability and Non-Waiver
