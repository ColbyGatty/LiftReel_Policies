Welcome to **LiftReel**, a social media, gaming, and fitness application operated by **C&M Technologies LLC** (“C&M,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of California. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of **LiftReel**, including its website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the “App” or “Services”).

By creating an account, accessing, downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms (which include and incorporate the Software License/EULA in Section 2) and acknowledge our Privacy Policy at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/privacy](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/privacy). If you do not agree, do not access or use the App.

## 1. Eligibility & Accounts

### 1.1 Age
You must be at least 13 years old to use the App, in compliance with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**. If you are 13–17, you represent that you have consent from a parent or legal guardian where required by applicable law. Users under 13 are strictly prohibited, and misrepresenting your age is a violation of these Terms. If we discover or are notified that a user is under 13, their account and data will be deleted promptly, as described in our Privacy Policy. Parents or guardians may contact us at [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com) to request deletion of a child’s data.

### 1.2 Account Creation & Security
You must provide accurate and current information when creating an account and keep it updated. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activities under your account. Notify us immediately of unauthorized use at [develop@cm-technologies.com](mailto:develop@cm-technologies.com).

### 1.3 Suspension/Termination
We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your account or access to the App at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms, applicable law, or if necessary to protect the App or other users.

### 10.1 Disclaimers
The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee availability, security, accuracy, or error-free operation.

### 10.2 Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, C&M and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages; or for lost profits, data loss, business interruption, personal injury, property damage, or emotional distress arising from or related to the App, competitions, UGC, or user interactions—even if advised of such possibility. In jurisdictions that do not allow certain exclusions, our liability is limited to the maximum extent allowed by law.

### 10.3 Assumption of Risk
You participate in challenges/competitions at your own risk (see Section 3).

### 10.4 Indemnity
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless C&M and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your UGC, your use of the App, or your breach of these Terms or violation of third-party rights.

## 11. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution

### 11.1 Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.

### 11.2 Binding Arbitration
Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the EULA in Section 2) shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California, in English. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. Costs of arbitration shall be borne as allocated by the arbitrator.

### 11.3 Class-Action Waiver
All proceedings are on an individual basis only. You waive any right to participate in a class action, class-wide arbitration, or representative action.

### 11.4 Courts for Non-Arbitrable Claims
If arbitration is found unenforceable for a specific claim, such claim must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts in Los Angeles County, California, and you consent to their personal jurisdiction and venue.

## 12. International Use
If you access the App from outside the United States, you are responsible for compliance with local laws, including data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR). Our Privacy Policy describes cross-border data transfers and safeguards.

## 13. Changes to the App & to These Terms
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any feature at any time, with or without notice. We may update these Terms by posting an updated version at [https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/terms](https://colbygatty.github.io/LiftReel_Policies/terms) or in-app. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 14. Third-Party Services & Links
The App may link to or integrate third-party websites, content, or services. We are not responsible for their content or practices. Review their terms and policies before using them.

## 15. Beta Features; Open-Source
We may release features labeled beta/preview that are provided as is and may change or be discontinued at any time. The App may contain components licensed under open-source licenses; those licenses govern the components in case of conflict.

## 16. Force Majeure
We are not liable for delays or failure to perform due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, war, terrorism, government actions, labor disputes, cyber incidents, or internet/hosting failures.

These Terms are effective until terminated. You may terminate by ceasing use and deleting the App. We may terminate at any time (see Section 1.3).

Sections 2.6, 3, 4.2–4.6, 5.2–5.3, 6–16, 17 (Survival), and 18–20 survive termination.

## 18. Precedence
These Terms (including the Software License/EULA in Section 2) control over any conflicting language in other policies or documents referenced here. If there is a conflict specifically about personal data processing, the Privacy Policy controls for that topic.

## 19. Severability; Non-Waiver; Assignment
If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce a right or provision is not a waiver. You may not assign or transfer your rights without our prior written consent; we may assign these Terms as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

## 20. Entire Agreement; Notices; Contact
